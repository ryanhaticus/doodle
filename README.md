# Doodle

Doodle is an **opinionated** starter kit built on the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework for [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Doodle aims to jump start web application development and allows developers to build production-ready applications without having to worry about complex directory structures, the user authentication pipline, SEO, etc.

### Development

Doodle is currently in active development by student talent at Iowa State University. At the moment, it is not recommended for use in critical application infrastructure. If you have any questions, please feel free to join our community discussion.
