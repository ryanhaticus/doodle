# Welcome to Doodle

### What technologies does Doodle leverage?

Doodle is described as opinionated for a reason. We support very specific tooling commonly used in modern JAMstack web development. More specifically:

* TypeScript
* Firebase
  * Firestore
  * Authentication
  * Storage
* NextJS (built on React)
  * API Routes
  * Middleware
* TailwindCSS
  * Modular CSS
* Jest

### Why Doodle?

As NextJS stands, there is no concrete way of communicating data throughout an application nor is there any real developer standards. As developers, we commonly find ourselves rewriting boiler plate code with minor improvements despite using the same core frameworks, libraries, and tools. Hence, the starter kit known as Doodle was born.

### What does Doodle provide?

As of now, Doodle provides the following key features:

* User Authentication Pipeline
  * via. Firebase Authentication and NextJS Middleware
* Pre-built React Components for Applications:
  * Core
  * Head
  * Loading
  * Logo
  * PageSeo
  * Seo
  * Toast
* Context Providers for:
  * Firebase
  * User
  * Toast

### Why not another framework?

Hundreds of frameworks have existed in the JavaScript world. While Doodle could theoretically have been developed as a standalone product, there is no keeping up with industry giants who pour thousands of development hours into frameworks like NextJS. Therefore, we didn't want to create our own framework, but instead leverage what is already leading the industry.

#### Who maintains Doodle?

At the moment, Doodle is being maintained by a student at Iowa State University. However, the project is actively looking for more hands. If you're interested, please feel free to reach out.
