# Get Started

### Using Doodle

Doodle is relatively simple to setup. All you have to do is [clone the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryanhaticus/doodle). You can do so by running this command in your terminal: `git clone` [`https://github.com/ryanhaticus/doodle`](https://github.com/ryanhaticus/doodle).

### Existing Projects

As Doodle isn't a framework but rather a starter kit, it isn't recommended to import Doodle project files into an existing NextJS project.

### Updating Doodle

Doodle is built to be concrete. If any major changes occur, you can update Doodle by overwriting the `/doodle` directory with new files from the repository.

> Major changes generally aren't expected. You shouldn't expect regular upgrades or changes unless security related vulnerabilities are discovered and addressed.

Please note, you will have to manually review changes to `doodle.config.ts` as this file may contain changes made by you, the developer.
